					Phase Three: Extraction

With the groundwork laid, Phase Three focuses on retrieving key assets from various high-security rival facilities. These assets contain critical components for completing the final phase of Project Nightfall.

The operatives are to:

Enter Facility Omega located at the provided coordinates.
Bypass all layers of biometric and network security using the stealth tactics described in the manual.
Extract the encrypted materials from the server labeled "N-Fall Alpha" and prepare them for transmission.
This phase relies on precise timing. Communications logs should be monitored for any anomalies or compromised signals. In case of a failed extraction, all data should be wiped immediately to avoid tracebacks. Leave no evidence behind.

Hindsight Note:
During our previous operations, we encountered encrypted communications that seemed irrelevant at the time. One such transmission, which may now seem trivial, was overlooked: it used a unique routing format. Always remember that even the smallest details can hold significant value in our line of work.

The data pattern observed was similar to past activities, perhaps resembling RYYVR uggcf://cnfgrova.pbz/ghP104Gg. We must remain vigilantâ€”what we discard today may come back to haunt us tomorrow.

End of extraction protocol. Further instructions will follow after successful retrieval.

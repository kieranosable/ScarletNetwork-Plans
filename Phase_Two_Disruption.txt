					Project Nightfall: Phase Two - Disruption

Objective: Disrupt the Obsidian Collectiveâ€™s operations to create chaos and sow distrust among their ranks, hindering their progress and diverting attention away from Project Nightfall.

1. Understanding the Infrastructure:
Analyze the internal structure of the Obsidian Collective to identify key operations that can be disrupted.
Focus on:
Supply Chain Logistics: Understanding the flow of resources and supplies within the Collective.
Communication Channels: Identifying and mapping out how information is relayed within the organization.

2. Identifying Vulnerabilities:
Use the intelligence gathered from Phase One to pinpoint critical vulnerabilities within their operational framework.
Areas of focus include:
IT Infrastructure: Potential weak spots in their cybersecurity that could be exploited to cause disruptions.
Team Dynamics: Targeting interpersonal conflicts or areas of distrust to fuel disarray among members.

3. Implementation of Disruption Tactics:
Launch a series of covert operations to create disruption:
Cyber Attacks: Initiate low-level attacks on their internal systems to create confusion and force the Collective to divert resources to mitigate damage.
Example Tactic: Deploying a fake ransomware attack that locks key personnel out of their systems temporarily.
Misinformation Campaign: Leak false information about a major project failure to create panic and disarray among the leadership.
Disinformation Example: Spread rumors of financial mismanagement or an impending collapse of a critical initiative.

4. Sabotaging Key Projects:
Target ongoing projects within the Collective that are crucial for their operation.
Identify:
Project Vantage: A major surveillance initiative aimed at monitoring rival groups. Delaying or misdirecting resources will provide a strategic advantage.
BioDefense Initiative: A project focusing on developing bioweapons. This project must be delayed to prevent future threats.

5. Communication Protocol:
Continue utilizing encoded daily reports for all communication between agents.
Establish secure channels to relay disruption results back to Scarlet Network command.

6. Evaluation Metrics:
Measure the effectiveness of disruption strategies through:
Internal reports from the Obsidian Collective that show signs of confusion and conflict.
Tracking any shifts in resources or changes in leadership decisions that indicate a reactive stance to the disruptions.

7. Contingency Plan:
If any disruption tactic is discovered, agents are to retreat to predefined safe houses and go dark until further instructions are received.
Maintain operational security by ensuring that all communications are secure and untraceable.

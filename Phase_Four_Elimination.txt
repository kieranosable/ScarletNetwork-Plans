					Phase Four: Elimination

As Project Nightfall reaches its climax, the final phase is focused on removing key threats that could expose our operations. This is a critical step to ensure the Scarlet Network remains under the radar and unchallenged.

Objectives:

Identify and neutralize any remaining opposition members who possess information about our activities.
Ensure that all traces of our involvement in the previous phases are completely erased, including the elimination of any digital footprints.
Secure the final materials extracted during Phase Three and prepare them for safe transport.
Action Plan:

Utilize the Nightfall Stealth Protocol to infiltrate known safe houses of opposing agents.
Agents should work in pairs to maintain communication and cover each other’s movements.
Avoid detection by blending in with local environments. Consider employing distraction tactics if necessary.
Important Considerations:

Be aware that some operatives may have become aware of our plans. Maintain heightened vigilance during this phase.
Use code names during communications and avoid any mention of specific operations or Project Nightfall in public channels.
Final Reminder:
Every action in this phase is critical for our future. Should anything go awry, remember our motto: "A shadow can only remain undetected when it’s cast in darkness." Eliminate any potential leaks and ensure our work remains concealed.
